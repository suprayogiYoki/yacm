Boarder	2	50+	Edit
3. Data Isolation
Tenant-Specific Property Listing (Landlord View)

Displayed Data (Table Format):
Property Name	Location	Total Rooms	Occupied	Vacant	Actions
Sunshine Villa	Austin, TX	20	15	5	Edit/View
Mountain Lodge	Denver, CO	10	8	2	Edit/View

Filters/Search:

    By Property Name/Location

    Vacancy Status (Occupied/Vacant)

Data Isolation Mechanism (Backend Logic)

    Database Query Example (PostgreSQL with RLS):
    sql

-- Row-Level Security Policy (RLS)
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON properties
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant'));

API Endpoint Security:
javascript

    // Express.js Middleware
    app.use("/api/properties", (req, res, next) => {
      if (req.user.tenant_id !== req.query.tenant_id) {
        return res.status(403).send("Access Denied");
      }
      next();
    });

Key Considerations

    URL Structure for Tenants

        https://app.com/{tenant_id}/dashboard

    Caching Tenant Context

        Store tenant_id in JWT tokens or session.

    Audit Logs

        Track tenant-specific actions for security.

Would you like a Figma mockup or detailed API schema for these forms? I can also provide sample React/Django code snippets! üõ†Ô∏è
